## *SPMS - Stock Portfolio Management System*

This is my first project with React.js: a web application to manage and visualize stock portfolios.

In addition to React, the app uses jQuery, Babel and chart.js.

The UI is designed from scratch by me, and all components except the rotating gear icon and chart graphics are my own creations. 
The gear icon is a free picture from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

The working app can be found at: [https://derjontte.github.io/SPMS/](https://derjontte.github.io/SPMS/).
